# MedGAN: Medical Image Translation using GANs

this code is an unofficial implementation of paper " MedGAN: Medical Image Translation using GANs , Karim Armanious et al." using pytorch<br>
link to paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06397

# How to use

add data pairs from two domain A and B in folders dataset/a , dataset/b<br>
models will be saved in logs folder<br>
tune hyper params from the notebook (some hyper params like patch shape require edditing the files directly)<br>
always verify the patch size to be 16 \* 16(default) or anything you want

# Note

code is still in early stage<br>
